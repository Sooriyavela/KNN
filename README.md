# KNN Classifier Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a custom K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier in Python. The KNN algorithm is a simple yet effective machine learning technique for classification and regression tasks, based on the concept of distance metrics.

## Features

- Supports multiple distance metrics:
  - **Euclidean Distance**
  - **Manhattan Distance**
  - **Minkowski Distance** (with customizable `p` parameter)
- Allows dynamic selection of the number of neighbors (`k`).
- Can be used for both classification and regression tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this implementation, you need the following dependencies installed in your Python environment:
- **NumPy**

You can install NumPy using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy
